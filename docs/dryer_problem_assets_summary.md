# Dryer Area problem assets

| Asset Name | Asset IDs | Failure Mode | Key DCS Tags |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| XV-18174 & XV-18176 |  | The air operated pop doors that seal the cyclones from external tramp air sometimes come off closed limits causing fast shutdown of the dryer.  |  |
| RV-1834 | , 2876, 3060, 3411 | Rotary Valve amps go high due to product build up around the bearing seals causing extra drag on the rotor. This causes the dryer to go into fast shutdown. |  |
| BL-1829 | , 10034, 2868 | The fan wheel gets product build up on it over time causing it to run un-balanced. This eventually causes the pillow block bearings housings to start wearing between the cap and the outerrace of the bearing leading to pre-mature bearing failures. |  |
| CV-1828 | , 2523 | The conveyor has experienced premature bearing failures that has caused excessive down time to the dryer equipment. This is an inlcine auger that takes alot of thrust load, the original spherical roller bearing that was specced out on the conveyor does not take thrust load very well. We have since changed to taper roller style bearing better suited for thrust loads but we have not had enough run time on them to know if this is going to fix the issue. | CH-DRYER_D_BMS:TT84207.PNT, CH-DR_DUSTCOLL:SY18216.OUT, CH-DR_DECANT701:XZSC17703A.CIN, CH-DRYER_D:P1803D.STAIND, CH-DRA_COMB_AIR:TT18180C.MEAS |
| DC-1834 | , 2537 | The dust collector has alot of moist air that goes through it causing the filter bags to clog off prematurely. This causes poor dust collection and also results in reduced air flow through the dryer system resulting in reduced dyer effeciency, and eventually down time if new filter bags are required to obtain proper air flow. |  |
| E-1834 | 2561 | The rotating rake in the product cooler that is meant to distribute the product evenly across the louvers often gets the distribution rakes moved out of position due to excessive levels in the cooler and higher than desirable moisture in the cooler. This also wears other mechanical components prematurely as well. |  |
| P-1837 | , 6660 | Multiple mechanical Seal failures due to poorly controlled water temperature that often gets over heated beyond the seal material specifications |  |
| EJ-1837 | 2563 | The injection tube often gets clogged up from scale that is a result of using city water in a steam system that should be using RO water.  |  |
| FT-18110, FT-18111 |  | sensors get build up on the giving a false low air flow reading, |  |
| PT-18215A, PT-18140 |  | PTs get blined over, potentioal false readings |  |
| LT-41310 | 3686 | gets build up on sensing rod, giving a fales reading. may just require a different technology. IE touchless |  |
